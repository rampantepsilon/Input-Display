---SNES Input Viewer v1.2.0.2---
-Created by TheLegendaryMudkip-

SNES Input Viewer is a program that allows you to visualize the input from a SNES controller on your monitor.
There are a few things you need to keep in mind, however.

-Limitations-
Currently this program only has support for SNES controllers, but that may change in the future.

I do not know if it supports every kind of SNES controller that can be plugged in. If it doesn't work, let me know. Details
of the kind of SNES controller you are using would be helpful. An PM on twitch should suffice, but fell free to try and
contact me in other ways if you cannot get hold of me there.

You need to have your controller plugged in to a port from port 0 to port 7, whichever you specified in the settings file.
